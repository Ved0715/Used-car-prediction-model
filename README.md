## Introduction

Our Car Prediction Model is built on state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to predict various attributes of cars, such as price, mileage, and more. The model has been trained on a comprehensive dataset to provide accurate and reliable predictions.

## Features

- **Multi-Task Learning:** Our model is capable of simultaneously predicting multiple attributes, making it versatile and useful for a wide range of applications.
- **Scalability:** The model can scale to handle large datasets, making it suitable for both small and large projects.

## Installation

To get started with the Car Prediction Model, follow the installation instructions outlined in the [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) file. This will guide you through the setup process, ensuring you have all the necessary dependencies installed.



## Dataset


Our model has been trained on a dataset from kagle. This is a dataset that can be used to apply regression algorithms for beginners. There are no missing value and the data set is small too.
The data set gives the second hand price of cars and its features like <br>
v.id<br>
on road old<br>
on road now<br>
years <br>
km  <br>
rating  <br>
condition   <br>
economy   <br>
top speed <br>
hp<br>
torque <br>
current price.<br>


NOTE:
The the data base size is small so the loss is high.<b>This model is just for learning perpose.</b>
